# Conversation Exporter Extension

The Conversation Exporter extension is a tool that allows you to export conversations from ChatGPT as HTML files. This makes it easier to share conversations with friends or keep a record of your chat history. The extension adds an export chat button to your ChatGPT interface, which you can click to save the conversation as an HTML file on your local device.

## Installation

To install the Conversation Exporter extension, follow these steps:

1. Go to the GitHub repository for the extension at `github.com/LianJordaan/Conversation-Exporter`.
2. Click on the "Clone or download" button and select "Download ZIP" to download the extension files as a ZIP archive.
3. Extract the ZIP archive to a folder of your choice on your local device.
4. Open your Chrome or Firefox web browser and go to the extensions management page. In Chrome, you can access this page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`, and in Firefox, you can go to `about:addons`.
5. Enable Developer mode or toggle the switch to "On" if it is not already enabled.
6. Click on the "Load unpacked" or "Load temporary add-on" button, depending on your browser, and select the folder where you extracted the extension files.
7. The Conversation Exporter extension should now be installed and active in your browser.

## Usage

Once the Conversation Exporter extension is installed, you can use it to export conversations from ChatGPT by following these steps:

1. Open ChatGPT in your web browser.
2. If the extension is enabled, you will see an "Export Chat" button in your ChatGPT interface.
3. If there are no chats visible or your icon is not found, the extension will show a message indicating that no chat is available for export.
4. Scroll up in the chat window if needed to make your icon visible, then click the "Export Chat" button.
5. Choose a location on your local device to save the exported chat as an HTML file.
6. Open the exported HTML file in a web browser to view the conversation.
7. Note that the exported HTML file may take some time to load, as it downloads the required CSS files separately.

You can also disable the Conversation Exporter extension at any time by going to your extensions management page in your browser and toggling the switch for the extension to "Off". This will remove the "Export Chat" button from your ChatGPT interface, but any previously exported chat files will still be accessible on your local device.

## Future Updates

The Conversation Exporter extension is continuously being improved, and future updates may include changes such as removing the additional buttons (e.g., dislike buttons) that are currently added to the exported chat files, as mentioned by the developer in the tutorial video. Additionally, the extension may be updated to allow for customization of the conversation title in the exported chat files.
